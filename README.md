# Collatz Story

Here is a brief, bizarre short story themed around the Collatz conjecture. In order to run the story, clone the repository, navigate to its directory in terminal, and run `$ python3 story.py`

I wrote this quickly before being spooked out of a park a few nights ago. Feel free to raise issues or submit pull requests if you've found typos, although I doubt it's worth your time!
